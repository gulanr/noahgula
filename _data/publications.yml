- publication: Optimization of Nuclear Thermal Propulsion Cooldown Using Real-Time Simulations, Experimental Approach
  publisher: The Ohio State University
  duration: May 2022
  description: This thesis documents the design, operation, and performance of the Nonnuclear Environmental Testing Facility constructed to investigate topics related to the cooldown period of nuclear thermal propulsion system operations. The test facility replicated the thermal environment experienced by tie tube assemblies, which included the components most sensitive to the extreme temperatures found within such systems. The facility was then used to show that for a certain decay heat level there exists a particular and measurable propellant mass flow rate which maintains the outlet flow temperature at a prescribed value. Also included are discussions on the range of possible experiments enabled by the test facility and the usefulness that it provides as an educational tool for undergraduate students.
