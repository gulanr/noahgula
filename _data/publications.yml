- publication: Optimization of Nuclear Thermal Propulsion Cooldown Using Real-Time Simulations, Experimental Approach
  publisher: The Ohio State University
  duration: May 2022
  description: This thesis documents the design, operation, and performance of the Nonnuclear Environmental Testing Facility constructed to investigate topics related to the cooldown period of nuclear thermal propulsion system operations. The test facility replicated the thermal environment experienced by tie tube assemblies, which included the components most sensitive to the extreme temperatures found within such systems. The facility was then used to show that for a certain decay heat level there exists a particular and measurable propellant mass flow rate which maintains the outlet flow temperature at a prescribed value. Also included are discussions on the range of possible experiments enabled by the test facility and the usefulness that it provides as an educational tool for undergraduate students.

  description: The goal of this paper is to articulate a strategy for developing and sustaining a robust and diverse workforce through periods of variable government funding which often result in a generational gap of talent. Historically, the current practice to develop workforces of high-technology domains has been fragmented, reactive, and largely untargeted. In the case of high-priority emerging (and reemerging) technology domains, educational offerings in academia (encompassing universities, community colleges, and trade schools) are limited. As a result, not only is the pool of talent constricted, but the alignment of training to the needs of government and industry is poor. Frequently these emerging technology domains are also heavily reliant on federal government funding, which makes them especially susceptible to well-documented federal boom-bust cycles resulting in devastating effects on the workforce.\n The challenge of sustaining a robust workforce for essential national needs is a recurring, classical characteristic of many countries and organizations. Government appropriations processes, coupled with election cycles and a complex stakeholder landscape, inhibits long-term, strategic action. History offers few successful examples of sustaining strategy over long baseline periods; and yet the quality and character of the workforce is nothing if not a very long baseline problem demanding sustained strategy. \nBecause there is a lack of policy infrastructure that supports sustained workforce development, resulting government and industrial workforce actions are largely crisis-driven. Current workforce development efforts are largely ad hoc, reactive, and implemented on an as-needed basis in response to the crisis of the moment. These efforts are inherently non-strategic because they focus on short-term outcomes and do not holistically approach challenges faced by government and industry alike. Instead, they can be best characterized as each stakeholder individually acting on its own more immediate needs, rather than integrating with other members in the domain and balancing near-term needs against longer-term outcomes.\n We performed a strategic policy analysis and interviewed subject matter experts in academia, industry, and government organizations in order to more thoroughly understand the challenges facing current and future workforce development efforts. This understanding enabled the identification of five targeted policy interventions which not only address the needs of each stakeholder group, but also the dynamics among the three groups. The proposed policy interventions are expected to mitigate some of the complex system dynamics which typically result in ad hoc or reactionary activity.

  description: This paper presents fundamental results of deposits that form in the internal cooling passages in a gas turbine engine. The method characterizes how a deposit grows and changes shape as a function of time. To demonstrate the method a sample test dust, AFRL with a size distribution of 0 %mdash; 5 um in diameter, was selected with care taken to remove agglomerates before the dust was injected at the test article. The effects of plate temperature, plate angle, and flow velocity on the growth of the deposit are also analyzed.  Results from this analysis are used to better inform the OSU Deposition Model which comprehensively models and predicts particle deposition behaviors.

- publication: Modeling the Mechanical Characteristics of a Piston Pressurant System

  description: In this paper we present an improved analytical model of the bipropellant piston pressurization system in regard to propellant pressure performance. Specifically, further refinement of the mechanical behavior of the device, including the friction of the pistons and applied actuator force, is performed. Previous work demonstrated the technical feasibility of a bipropellant piston tank in a stacked configuration. This demonstration leveraged experimental results along with a preliminary data analysis. This device was intended to provide an alternative pressurization system for spacecraft and launch vehicles where precision and predictability of propellant systems are critical. This new work considers an imbalance in applied force between the two piston heads and investigates this effect on the dynamic performance of the device. This change in its analytical model reduces uncertainty in the experimental data previously gathered and better refines the conclusions made in the previous work.

  description: In this paper we present a new form of propellant tank pressurization systems for bipropellant engine configurations and demonstrate its effectiveness in design simplicity, mass reduction, and cost savings on the system. This tank configuration is intended for liquid bipropellant launch vehicles with additional applications to spacecrafts, where precision and predictability of fluid mass flow are critical.\n Currently, propellants are typically stored in separate tanks each with their own independent inert gas pressurant system. Such a system requires at least an additional tank to store the pressurant gas, additional plumbing, and a complex control system.\n In this new design, both propellants are stored inside the same tank, separated by a piston head device, in a stacked configuration. The upper fluid is contained by another piston head, which is driven by an actuator. The actuator presses down on the fluids which in turn keeps them pressurized to the desired level. Doing so keeps both propellants at the same pressure and expels them with a proportional mass flow rate equal to the oxidizer-fuel ratio. This system offers advantages in its simple approach and reduced mass since both tanks are combined to one without the need for a separate pressurant system. While this paper demonstrates the design\'s cost savings, future research will more closely investigate the effect of propellant sloshing, and the control of the modal behaviors of the tank by adjusting the actuator\'s force pushing on the fluid.
