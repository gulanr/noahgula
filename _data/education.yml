  summary: I wrote a thesis on utilizing real-time simulations to optimize propellant consumption during the cooldown phase of nuclear thermal propulsion engine operations. To do this, I lead a team of undergraduate students developing software, CFD models, and constructing a test facility which simulates the thermal environment of a tie tube in NERVA-derived NTP core.
